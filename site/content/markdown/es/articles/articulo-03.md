									<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a young Spanish engineer built the first version of a low-cost neonatal incubator in 2015, he could hardly have imagined how far that idea would go. Today, nearly a decade later, that small technological revolution has changed its name — but not its purpose.</span></p><p><b>In3ator</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as the project was originally called, was the starting point. It marked our first steps and the birth of our commitment to neonatal innovation. Today, that seed has evolved into </span><b>IncuNest</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — a transformation that goes far beyond a simple name change. It represents the transition from a personal initiative to a global, collective, and rapidly expanding organization. A new identity that reflects who we are: a brand that grows, innovates, and continues saving lives with both technology and heart.</span></p><h3><b>A Simple Idea, a Huge Impact</b></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It all began with one powerful question: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">How can we give a premature baby in a low-resource country the same chance of survival as one in any advanced hospital?</span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer was </span><b>In3ator</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: a portable, open-source incubator built with 3D printing and affordable materials, costing just €350 — compared to more than €35,000 for a commercial incubator.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, we took the next step and founded Medical Open World, a nonprofit organization created to develop this technology, scale its impact, and bring it where it’s needed most.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, the incubator has continued to evolve. Today, over 220 units are active in more than 30 countries, and it’s estimated to have helped save the lives of more than 4,000 newborns.</span></p><h3><b>A Nest That Keeps Growing</b></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IncuNest is more than just a new name — it’s a symbol of who we are and what we strive to be.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our philosophy remains the same: open source, accessible, and human-centered. Beyond providing warmth and life to thousands of babies, IncuNest is helping reshape how we think about medical technology. The new name — a blend of “incubator” and “nest” — conveys exactly that: a warm, vital refuge for the most vulnerable.</span></p>								</div>
